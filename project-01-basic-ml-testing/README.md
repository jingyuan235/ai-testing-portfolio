# Project 1: Basic ML Testing Framework

## Overview
Built a complete ML model testing framework applying strategies from Rahul Shetty's ML Testing course.

## What I Built
- **model_development.py**: Logistic regression model for loan approval
- **testing_framework.py**: Comprehensive testing suite including:
  - Data quality testing
  - Performance validation  
  - Overfitting detection
  - Automated reporting

## Results
- Model Accuracy: 98%(0.9800)
- Overfitting Status: PASSED (gap < 10%)
- Overall Status: PASSED

## Skills Demonstrated
- ML model development
- AI testing methodologies
- Python automation
- Quality assurance for AI systems

## Next Steps
- Deploy as API for testing
- Add bias testing
- Implement continuous monitoring
